# Sentence 1

We become defensive when criticised, and apply negative stereotypes to
 others to boost our own esteem.

## paragraph:

We often become defensive when criticised, applying negative stereotypes to others in a vain attempt to boost our own esteem. However, such behavior only serves to underestimate and offend those around us, potentially leading to humiliation.

True self-confidence arises not from putting others down, but from genuine self-reflection and a profound recognition of our strengths and weaknesses. With empirical evidence and deliberate effort, we can identify areas for growth and oversee our personal development.

Those who complain, curse, or lash out at perceived slights frequently do so from a place of insecurity, desperately seeking a sense of superiority. Yet this path leads only to further reproach and scorn. The wiser course is to approach criticism with an open mind, separating valid feedback from baseless insults.

In this life, we are all participants on a journey of growth. By avoiding the pitfalls of vanity and defensiveness, we open ourselves to the paradise of deeper understanding. Though the road may be long, maintaining an attitude of humility allows us to portray our best selves to the world.

# Sentence 2

Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point.

## paragraph:

As a devoted concertgoer, Sarah always looked forward to the vibrant atmosphere of live performances. The music director of the philharmonic orchestra was a true artistic genius, whose unpretentious manner belied his formidable conducting skills. Sarah found the solemn and divine quality of classical music deeply impressive.

The musicians were all talented instrumentalists, and their brisk tempos and energetic playing never failed to attract an enthusiastic audience. Even in retrospect, the novelty and mysteriousness of the opera house's acoustics filled Sarah with awe. Comparatively, listening to recordings at home on iTunes, while convenient, could never quite replicate the magic of those evenings spent enraptured by the philharmonic's spellbinding artistry.

Ever since her first visit to the museum's music exhibit as a child, Sarah had been an art-loving listener accustomed to the unpretentious atmosphere of the concert hall. She relished the opportunity to relay her passion for live music to others. For Sarah, the availability of recorded performances was no substitute for the thrill of witnessing such musical mastery in the flesh.

# Sentence 3

Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes.

## paragraph:

It was a prosperous time for the giant tech company IncorpCorp. They had dominated the market with their innovative products and services. However, their success didn't come without challenges.

Competitors were constantly trying to acquire their customers and undermine their identity as the industry leader. IncorpCorp had to undertake major initiatives to update their offerings and utilize the latest technologies. They couldn't afford to fall behind the current trends.

The company's input from consumers revealed an imbalance - while their software was intricate and cutting-edge, the hardware was clumsy and outdated. The CEO knew they were liable to lose market share if they didn't replace the faulty components soon.

Notwithstanding the risks, she decided to venture into manufacturing their own devices. It was an ambitious scheme that would require massive investment. But she was confident it would repay them in the long run by giving them more control over the supply chain.

IncorpCorp brought in top engineers and guaranteed them record salaries to join the project. Progress was slow initially, but soon they had a prototype ready. Incidentally, it was an ant-inspired design that kept predatory insects and spammers out of the inbox-like chassis.

Though the road ahead looked challenging, the CEO was astonished by their achievements so far. She knew that with hard work and a spirit of reciprocal support, her team could overcome any obstacles. IncorpCorp was ready to take the tech world by storm once again.

# Sentence 4

At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity.

## paragraph:

Fire has long been a double-edged sword for humanity. On one hand, it provides warmth, light, and the ability to cook food - necessities of life. On the other hand, uncontrolled flames can cause catastrophic damage, dispersing embers that ignite buildings and vegetation. The frequency and adverse impacts of wildfires seem to be increasing annually due to climate change aggravating dry conditions.

At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity. Specialists work tirelessly to extinguish blazes and prevent further destruction. Firefighting agencies deploy personnel and equipment at great expenditure to battle the roaring flames. Evacuations are ordered for districts threatened by the encroaching inferno, with casualties a grim possibility if the blaze cannot be quenched.

However, many ecologists argue that fire plays a vital role in certain ecosystems by clearing out dead vegetation and allowing new growth. This clash of perspectives highlights how humans have an uneasy relationship with fire. We seek to simplify it as something to be eliminated, yet it is an integral part of the natural cycle that replenishes forests and grasslands.

Striking a balance requires understanding fire's nuances - its necessity for renewal but also its potential for devastation if allowed to rage unchecked. By studying its patterns and effects, we can learn to mitigate risks through precautions while letting fire play its role in maintaining ecological health. Only then can we move toward a holistic approach that neither suppresses nor unleashes this powerful force indiscriminately.

# Sentence 5

As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don't get the nod also may wish to move on.

## paragraph:

As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don't get the nod may wish to move on and pursue new ambitions. In the ever-turbulent business environment, senior managers often find themselves at a crossroads, facing unconventional career paths.

For those aspiring candidates who fail to secure the coveted chief executive or chairman roles within their current organizations, the decision to quit can be a difficult one. However, such setbacks should not dampen their spirits or tarnish their reputation as capable leaders. Instead, they may choose to broadcast their qualifications and leverage their expertise, potentially attracting headhunters and recruiters from Internet-based firms.

While the prospect of leaving a familiar environment can be **daunting**, it also presents an opportunity for personal and professional growth. Executives who embrace change and adhere to ethical principles are more likely to find themselves in roles that align with their aspirations and values. Surprisingly, some may even discover **newfound** passions or uncover **avenues** for innovation they had not previously considered.

In navigating these **precarious** waters, a cautious yet **resolute** approach is **advisable**. Seeking guidance from mentors or trusted advisors can provide valuable insights and **foster** a sense of **solidarity**. Additionally, maintaining a positive outlook and projecting confidence can be **instrumental** in securing future prospects.

**Ultimately**, the ability to adapt and **thrive** in the face of **adversity** is a **hallmark** of true leadership. By remaining resilient, **compassionate**, and open to unconventional paths, executives can emerge from challenging transitions as **beacons** of inspiration, their ambitions kindled **anew**.

# Sentence 6

Everyone needs to find their extra - their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.

## paragraph:

In today's rapidly evolving job market, it is crucial for individuals to identify and cultivate their unique strengths and abilities, often referred to as their "extra". This exceptional quality serves as a valuable contribution that sets them apart from others in their chosen field of employment.

As automation continues to surge, certain tasks and jobs may become obsolete or subject to outsourcing to foreign countries with lower labor costs. However, those who possess a distinct "extra" are less likely to be undermined or discarded in this ever-changing landscape. Their invaluable skills and characteristics propel them forward, enabling them to surpass the ordinary and strive towards new heights.

This "extra" can manifest in various forms, such as exceptional problem-solving abilities, a knack for innovation, or a stubborn determination to overcome obstacles. It may be a precious talent for welding intricate designs or an impetus to manufacture cost-effective, eco-friendly textiles. Regardless of its nature, this unique quality serves as a driving momentum, empowering individuals to make notable contributions to their field.

While some may joke about the notion of an "extra," its importance cannot be overstated. In a world where machines and automation increasingly dominate, human ingenuity and creativity remain invaluable assets. Those who can identify and cultivate their distinctive strengths will not only stand out but also be worthy of recognition and success.

Ultimately, the pursuit of one's "extra" is a continuous journey of self-discovery and growth. It requires the courage to abandon complacency, the willingness to fluctuate and adapt, and the resilience to summon the strength to persevere. By embracing this mindset, individuals can transcend the ordinary and contribute their unique value to the world around them.

# Sentence 7

It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself. 

## paragraph:

The Composer's Revelation

Michael was a talented young composer, but he had always struggled to describe the profound emotions music could evoke. His compositions were technically marvelous, with intense rhythms and harmonies that impressed critics. However, he felt his works lacked an underlying spiritual depth.

One night, Michael was awoken by the abrupt sound of his neighbor's rock band practicing. At first, the chaos of sounds was purely disruptive. But then he overheard an echo of a familiar melody weaving through the cacophony. It was the prelude to his latest concerto! 

Suddenly, the coexistence of the two contrasting musical forces - his delicate composition intertwined with the band's raw energy - unleashed a metaphysical revelation. Michael realized music transcended verbal description because it grasped something primal within the human soul. It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.

Inspired, Michael spent the next few weeks feverishly revising his symphony. He infused it with daring crescendos and consecutive movements that mirrored life's unpredictability. The revolutionary composition's sensual rhythms refreshed the spirit like an invigorating summer rain.

At the premiere, the courageous new work received a standing ovation. For the first time, Michael's music had captured the very essence of the poetic and philosophical mysteries that had plagued him as an artist. That night, his soul danced in harmony with the universe.

# Sentence 8

Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them.


## paragraph:

It was a sunny spring day in the forest. The biologists were studying the continuance of various creatures in their natural habitat. Distinctly marked butterflies fluttered among the budding bushes and towering pines.

Suddenly, they noticed pronounced signs of insect infestation on the oak trees. Swarms of moths, wasps and other pests were preying on the tender leaves and stems. The foresters jumped to the rescue, armed with insecticides to combat the voracious invaders that threatened to eat up the entire reserve.

However, the evidence they had gathered was rather shaky. Some believed using harsh chemicals would disrupt the ecological balance and prove uneconomic in the long run. The botanists argued that manually removing weeds and preserving native herbs could be a more sustainable solution.

As the debate raged, an unexpected ally arrived - a flock of birds! The winged hunters descended, their beaks snapping up the hapless bugs and crickets. Within hours, the painful insect invasion was brought under control, thanks to nature's remarkable stability.

The scientists marveled at this transparent display of the circle of life. They realized human self-interest often failed to see the bigger picture. From that day on, they vowed to entitle the forest to its rightful ethic - one of noncommercial, biotic preservation through judicious inversion of conventional practices.

# Sentence 9

A moralist, satirist, and social reformer, Dickens crafted complex plots and
 striking characters that capture the panorama of English society.

## paragraph:

A moralist, satirist, and social reformer, Charles Dickens crafted complex plots and striking characters that vividly capture the panorama of 19th-century English society. With his celebrated novels serialized in installments, Dickens combined comic elements with dark social commentary, faithfully depicting the bleak backdrop of poverty, social conflicts, and humiliation endured by the underprivileged.

One of Dickens' most famous works, "Oliver Twist," tells the story of an orphan boy who escapes from a workhouse and plunges into the underworld of Victorian London. Despite his impoverished background, Oliver possesses an inherent goodness that stands in stark contrast to the cruelty and mockery he faces. The novel exposed the harsh realities of child labor, earning Dickens international fame as a voice for reform.

In another of his best-known novels, "Great Expectations," Dickens explores themes of class, wealth, and moral redemption through the life of Pip, a young man of humble origins. The complex plot interweaves Pip's experiences with an array of striking characters, from the eccentric Miss Havisham to the convict Magwitch, whose generosity ultimately challenges society's prejudices.

A true man of letters, Dickens' reputation as a social reformer remains respectable and enduring. His novels transcended mere entertainment, shining a light on the dark corners of English society and giving voice to the unacknowledged masses. Through his powerful prose, Dickens inspired generations to confront injustice and work towards a more equitable world.

# Sentence 10

Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living.


## paragraph:

In the fertile countryside of Oakwood, agriculture had been the lifeblood for centuries. Peasants tilled the rich clay soil, sowing crops and tending orchards of ripe peaches. Flocks of sheep grazed in the verdant meadows, their bleats joining the barks of sheepdogs.

The village elders were no strangers to hardship - droughts, famines, and the backbreaking toil of ploughing fields with wooden ploughs pulled by oxen. But their spirits could never be felled. They dug ditches and irrigation trenches to channel water from the reservoir to nourish the thirsty land.

Half a century of visionary town and country planning enabled Oakwood to retain this enviable rural coherence while embracing sustainable urban living. Historic barns were renovated into rustic inns. The old smithy became an artisanal bakery, fragrant with fresh bread. Villagers found new livelihoods beyond tilling the soil - as outdoor guides leading hiking tours, or patiently drilling visitors in the ancient arts of fly fishing.

Though infrastructure modernized with paved roads and utilities, the village's roots remained firmly planted. On fertile plains once scythed by peasants wielding sharpened spears as makeshift scythes, eco-friendly residential neighborhoods now blossomed with gardens. The green belt surrounding Oakwood reclaimed land once depleted by poor agricultural practices, now a protected haven for wildlife.

From the village core to the farthest outlying farms, an enviable symbiosis was forged between urban amenities and the pastoral rhythms of rural life. Sensible planning opposed unsustainable overcrowding, instead endorsing low-density living in harmony with nature. Profits from tourism were reinvested into conservation efforts, launching renewal projects to restore natural landscapes. Though alternative concepts had been floated, Oakwood's considered approach struck the ideal balance between progress and tradition.

Oakwood had become a national model for how considered planning could marry countryside and city, allowing both to thrive. Its dwellers took immense pride and sentiment in this coherent vision, a sustainable future built upon the bedrock of their agricultural heritage.

# Sentence 11

Integrity had collapsed, she argued, because of a collective acceptance that the only “sorting mechanism” in society should be profit and the market.

## paragraph:

In a small town, there lived a greedy businessman named John. His sole profit motive was to make lucrative deals at any cost, even if it meant betraying his moral principles. Without mercy, he would bully and intimidate his competitors through bribery and deception.

One day, John fabricated false earnings reports to secure a lucrative market share. His notorious actions stained the town's reputation for honesty and straightforwardness. The townsfolk, known for their civic virtue and diligence, were outraged. They argued that integrity had collapsed because of a collective acceptance that the only "sorting mechanism" in society should be profit and the market.

Feeling envious of John's ill-gotten gains, some followed his disreputable path of fraud and gambling in stocks. Others confessed their mistakes with humility, vowing to uphold traditional morality and social norms. The mayor conceded that corruption had taken root due to lack of virtue education and called for a return to basic principles of kindness and courtesy.

Realizing his superficial knowledge had led him astray, John finally confessed to his crimes. He was sentenced to repay his net profit and forbidden from any vice presidential roles. With due diligence, the town rebuilt its moral example, proving that no disposable worker or fixed capital is worth sacrificing one's virtues for fleeting turnover.

# Sentence 12


We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever.


## paragraph:

Sitting at her piano, Maria's fingers danced across the keys as she played an energetic melody. She could hardly imagine a life without music - the harmonica, violin, and accordion had been her constant companions growing up as an immigrant child. Her parents had made the mighty decision to migrate from their war-torn homeland, becoming refugees in search of a permanent safe haven. Though their journey had been fraught with hardships, music provided ease and affection during the most rigid times.

In this new country, Maria's entrepreneurial father opened a music shop, selling guitars, trumpets, flutes, and more. It was a modest framework for their new life, but it allowed them to embrace the multicultural community. Maria's passion for the cello blossomed, and by the tender age of sixteen, she was hailed as a prodigy. Prestigious conservatories beckoned with proposals for her to study, but her father's logic prevailed - she should experience life as a productive member of society first before committing herself eternally to music.

And so, Maria spent a few years exploring other avenues, though music remained the unshakable core of her being. When the honorable opportunity to teach at the local college arose, she proclaimed her enthusiasm wholeheartedly. The outcome was better than she could have imagined - using music as the universal language, she could accommodate students from all backgrounds and attitudes toward a shared affection for the art. As the drumbeats of her pupils' progress echoed through the halls, Maria knew she had found her permanent place in this adopted land without having to depart from her deepest passion.
